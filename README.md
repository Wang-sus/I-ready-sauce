### I-ready-sauce
most if not all of iReadys source code stored in one repo please do expect some code to still be obfuscated as for some reason they felt the need to obfuscate shit in
an obfuscated code. Modding iReady should now be easier to do now that everybody will have access to its source code.

### How it was possible
iReady used the worst obfuscator in existants (obfuscator.io) and easily it was deobfuscated
